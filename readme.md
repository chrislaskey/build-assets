General purpose build scripts for combining web assets into optimized files,
including processes like LESS compilation, CSS minification, and JavaScript
library combination.

These files are for [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
/ [Buildr](http://buildr.apache.org/). This repo also includes a simple
auto-build monitoring script written in Python.
